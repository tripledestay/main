### Variable Conversion####
###str in the print fuction statement
length = 10
width = 5
Area = length * width
print("The Size of the size of the square is " + str(Area))

total = 2048 + 4357 + 97658 + 125 + 8
files = 5
average = total / files
print("The average size is: " + str(average))

Implicit vs Explicit Conversion
Implicit happens by default.  Float and interger is an example.  String cannot be automatically converted.
Explicit needs to be defined like str function above
