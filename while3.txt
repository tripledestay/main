##### While Loop####

def attempts(n):
    x = 0
    while x <= n:
        print("Attempt " + str(x))
        x += 1
    print("Done")

Input:    
attempts(5)

Output:
Attempt 0
Attempt 1
Attempt 2
Attempt 3
Attempt 4
Attempt 5
Done

def count_down(start_number):
  current = start_number
  while (current > 0):
    print(current)
    current -= 1
  print("Zero!")
  
Input:
count_down(3)

output
Here is your output:
3
2
1
Zero!

You nailed it! By initializing the current variable you got
the function to behave correctly.
def print_range(start, end):
	# Loop through the numbers from start to end
	n = start
	while n <= end:
		print(n)
		n = n + 1

print_range(1, 5)  # Should print 1 2 3 4 5 (each number on its own line)
